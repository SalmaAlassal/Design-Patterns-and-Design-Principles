# Design Principles and Patterns

Software design principles and design patterns are essential concepts in software engineering that help in creating maintainable, scalable, and flexible code. Understanding and applying these principles and patterns can lead to better code organization, reusability, and easier maintenance.

### Design Principles vs. Design Patterns

**Design Principles** are **general guidelines** that can guide your class structure and relationships. On the other hand, **Design Patterns** are proven **solutions** that solve commonly reoccurring problems.

### Design Patterns vs. Architectural Patterns

**Design Patterns** are **low-level** patterns that deal with the **implementation** of objects and classes. On the other hand, **Architectural Patterns** are **high-level** patterns that deal with the **overall architecture** of software systems.

## [SOLID Principles](./Design%20Principles/SOLID/README.md)

The SOLID principles represent five fundamental principles of OOP and design that can guide you in creating more robust and maintainable software.

See [SOLID Principles](./Design%20Principles/SOLID/README.md) for more details.

# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are grouped into three main categories:

### [Creational Patterns](./Design%20Patterns/Creational%20Patterns/README.md)

Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [Singleton](./Design%20Patterns/Creational%20Patterns/Singleton.md)
- [Prototype](./Design%20Patterns/Creational%20Patterns/Prototype.md)
- [Factory Method](./Design%20Patterns/Creational%20Patterns/Factory_Method.md)
- [Abstract Factory](./Design%20Patterns/Creational%20Patterns/Abstract_Factory.md)
- [Builder](./Design%20Patterns/Creational%20Patterns/Builder.md)

### [Structural Patterns](./Design%20Patterns/Structural%20Patterns/README.md)

Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

### [Behavioral Patterns](./Design%20Patterns/Behavioral%20Patterns/README.md)

Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
