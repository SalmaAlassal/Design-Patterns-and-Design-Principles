# Design Principles and Patterns

Software design principles and design patterns are essential concepts in software engineering that help in creating maintainable, scalable, and flexible code. Understanding and applying these principles and patterns can lead to better code organization, reusability, and easier maintenance.

# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles represent five fundamental principles of OOP and design that can guide you in creating more robust and maintainable software.

See [SOLID Principles](./SOLID/README.md)
 - [Single Responsibility Principle](./SOLID/Single_Responsibility_Principle.md)
 - [Open-Closed Principle](./SOLID/Open_Closed_Principle.md)
 - [Liskov Substitution Principle](./SOLID/Liskov_Substitution_Principle.md)
 - [Interface Segregation Principle](./SOLID/Interface_Segregation_Principle.md)
 - [Dependency Inversion Principle](./SOLID/Dependency_Inversion_Principle.md)


# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are grouped into three main categories:

### 1. Creational patterns

Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

#### Explained

#### To Be Explored

- [Singleton](./creational/singleton.md)
- [Factory Method](./creational/factory-method.md)
- [Abstract Factory](./creational/abstract-factory.md)
- [Builder](./creational/builder.md)
- [Prototype](./creational/prototype.md)

### 2. Structural patterns

Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

#### Explained

#### To Be Explored
- [Adapter](./structural/adapter.md)
- [Bridge](./structural/bridge.md)
- [Composite](./structural/composite.md)
- [Decorator](./structural/decorator.md)
- [Facade](./structural/facade.md)
- [Flyweight](./structural/flyweight.md)
- [Proxy](./structural/proxy.md)


### 3. Behavioral patterns

Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

#### Explained

#### To Be Explored
- [Chain of Responsibility](./behavioral/chain-of-responsibility.md)
- [Command](./behavioral/command.md)
- [Iterator](./behavioral/iterator.md)
- [Mediator](./behavioral/mediator.md)
- [Memento](./behavioral/memento.md)
- [Observer](./behavioral/observer.md)
- [State](./behavioral/state.md)
- [Strategy](./behavioral/strategy.md)
- [Template Method](./behavioral/template-method.md)
- [Visitor](./behavioral/visitor.md)
