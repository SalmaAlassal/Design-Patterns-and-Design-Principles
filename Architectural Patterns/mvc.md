# MVC Pattern

MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is an architectural pattern that separates the application logic from the user interface. It does this by separating the application into three parts: the **model**, the **view**, and the **controller**.

The MVC pattern helps you break up the frontend and backend code into separate components. This way, it's much easier to manage and make changes to either side without them interfering with each other.

### Model

The Model represents the application's core data and business logic. It is responsible for data storage, retrieval, manipulation, and ensuring data integrity. In essence, the Model encapsulates the application's data and the rules for working with it.

### View

The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It handles the user interface, displaying information and receiving user input. Views are designed to be user-friendly and are often the components users directly interact with.

### Controller

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, interacts with the Model to fetch or update data, and then instructs the View to update the interface accordingly. Controllers play a pivotal role in managing the flow of the application.

## Data Flow

In MVC, data flows in the following manner:

1. A user interacts with the View by providing input (e.g., clicking a button or entering data).
2. The View sends this input to the Controller.
3. The Controller processes the input and may interact with the Model to update or retrieve data.
4. The Controller then instructs the View to update its display based on the changes in the Model.

## Common Use Cases

The MVC pattern is used in many different frameworks, such as :
- Spring MVC
- Ruby on Rails
- Django
- Laravel
- ASP.NET MVC
- AngularJS

## Variations of MVC

There are variations of the MVC pattern, such as **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** and **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**.

These variations adapt the basic MVC structure to address specific needs, often in the context of different technologies or frameworks.
