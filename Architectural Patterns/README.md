# Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns are used to solve recurring problems in software architecture. They provide a blueprint or template for structuring and organizing software components to achieve specific objectives.

It's important to note that architectural patterns are not the same as design patterns. Design patterns are used to solve problems at a lower level, such as how to implement a specific feature or how to structure a class. Architectural patterns are used to solve problems at a higher level, such as how to structure the code, how to organize the data, and how to communicate between different parts of the system.

## Types of Architectural Patterns

### [MVC (Model-View-Controller)](./mvc.md)

It separates the application logic from the user interface. It does this by separating the application into three parts: the **model**, the **view**, and the **controller**.

### [Layered (n-tier) Architecture](./layered-architecture.md)

It divides the software application into multiple horizontal layers. Each layer is responsible for performing different tasks.
