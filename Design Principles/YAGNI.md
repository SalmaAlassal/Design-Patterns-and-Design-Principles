# You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)

The YAGNI principle states that you should not add functionality until it is necessary. In other words, don't implement something until you need it.

*Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.*

Even if you are totally sure that you will need a feature or piece of code later on, do not implement it now. Most likely, you will not need it after all or what you actually need is quite different from what you foresaw needing earlier.
