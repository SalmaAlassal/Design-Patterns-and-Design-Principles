# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. They help in ensuring that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn’t need to do the same. They also assist in recasting parts of the system which don’t fit a particular purpose into those that do.

## Structural Patterns

### [Adapter](./adapter.md)

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### [Bridge](./bridge.md)

Split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

### [Composite](./composite.md)

Compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

### [Decorator](./decorator.md)

Attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

### [Facade](./facade.md)

Provide a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

### [Flyweight](./flyweight.md)

Fitting more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

### [Proxy](./proxy.md)

Provide a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
